## ‚ú® Features

* **Create Nodes**: Add new child nodes to the currently active node.
* **Incrementing Labels**: Each new node is automatically assigned an incrementing number (e.g., "2", "3", "4").
* **Select Nodes**: Tap any node to make it the active node, changing where new nodes are added.
* **Delete Nodes**: Deleting a parent node will automatically delete all of its children and their descendants.
* **Visual Hierarchy**: The graph is displayed visually to clearly show the hierarchical relationship between nodes.
